# 🚀 PlanWithIn

### Discover your day, optimized.

**PlanWithIn** is a full-stack smart itinerary generator designed for people who find themselves stuck in unfamiliar places — train delays, airport layovers, unexpected free time, or exploring a new city.

Instead of endlessly searching what to do, PlanWithIn detects your location, understands your constraints (time, budget, preferences), and generates an optimized real-world activity plan — instantly.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Modern travel disruptions and spontaneous downtime often leave people stranded in unfamiliar environments with no clear way to utilize their time productively.

Whether waiting at a railway station due to delays, managing jet lag at an airport, or navigating an unknown city, users lack tools that combine **location awareness, time constraints, cost awareness, and personal interests** into a single decision system.

**PlanWithIn solves this by:**

* Detecting real-time location
* Discovering nearby activities
* Estimating travel time and cost
* Generating structured itineraries
* Providing fallback plans when constraints are tight

It transforms uncertainty into structured exploration.
